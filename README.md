<h4>Medicyl is a blockchain-based decentralized medical record management system.

### Inspiration

An electronic health record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient's medical and treatment histories.
There is no authentic report on the number of  patients whose EMRs/EHRs have been stored so far and an acute lack of security and privacy. Hence, a modern implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) is required  in India.

The idea that any person in India can go to any health service provider, pharmacy and have accessible fully integrated and always available health records in an electronic format is not only empowering but also the vision for efficient 21st century healthcare delivery.
